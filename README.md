# Bootstraps

This repo hosts a single [node.list](./node.list) file which serves as an alternative to the hard-coded bootstrap node list. This list is used by Vechain [thor](https://github.com/vechain/thor).

Hosting the list on Github Pages eliminates the need for updating the software once the bootstrap nodes update occurs, thus more convenient and elegant😏.

The full list is accessible publicly via HTTP to the URL https://vechain.github.io/bootstraps/node.list.
